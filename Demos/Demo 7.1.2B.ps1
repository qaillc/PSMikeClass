# Run $data to see what's in the variable. It isn't what
# should have been expected - it's the entire file, not

# Pipe $data to Get-Member to verify that it's a custom
# object that has a single property, which is the entire
# CSV column header. That's not right.

# The problem is the CSV file. The quotes are making each line

# That doesn't look correct - enter H to halt the command again.
